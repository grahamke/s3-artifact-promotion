> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This project is under active development.** Interfaces and behavior may change until v1.0.0 is released.

A reusable GitHub Actions workflow for promoting versioned build artifacts to an S3 bucket using secure AWS OIDC authentication. Automatically archives previous versions and promotes the new one as `latest/`.


### ‚úÖ What it does:
- Uploads a versioned artifact to a `myapp/latest/` path in your bucket (filename includes version)
- If a previous artifact exists in `latest/`, it is archived to `archive/myapp/latest/`
- Keeps artifact versioning clean, consistent, and rollback-friendly
- Requires no long-lived AWS credentials ‚Äî uses GitHub OIDC + IAM role

      app_name: myapp
      version: 1.2.3
      artifact_path: ./build/myapp-1.2.3.jar
      bucket_name: ${{ vars.S3_BUCKET_NAME }}
      aws_region: us-east-1
      role_to_assume: ${{ secrets.ROLE_TO_ASSUME }}
